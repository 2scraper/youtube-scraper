proxy_pool.py
--------------
A pool of proxy URLs and the rules for moving between them.

Why this exists as its own module: `--proxy` was a single static string
applied once at browser launch and never changed. That is the shape of a
demo, not of the thing proxies are bought for — the reason to hold a pool is
to spread a run across exits and to leave an exit that has started getting
challenged. The README sent readers to buy proxies without showing the
pattern; this is that pattern.

Kept engine-agnostic and side-effect free (no browser, no network) so the
rotation rules are covered by the offline suite rather than only by a live
run.

**Rotating the IP alone is not enough, and this is the part that is easy to
get wrong.** Carrying the same browser session across two exits is itself a
contradiction: cookies a bot manager issued against IP A, replayed from
IP B, are a stronger signal than either address on its own. So a caller must
build a FRESH browser context (new cookie jar, new storage) for every exit
this pool hands out — see playwright_scraper.py, which tears the browser
down and relaunches rather than swapping the proxy under a live session.

    Host and port stay visible on purpose — knowing WHICH exit a run used is
    the whole point of a rotation log, and it is not the secret.

    THIS FUNCTION MUST NEVER RAISE. It is the last thing standing between a
    password and a log, and it is called precisely when something is already
    wrong with the value. An earlier version read `parsed.port`, which
    `urlparse` computes lazily and which raises ValueError on a malformed
    authority — so the masker blew up on exactly the input that most needed
    masking, and the caller printed the raw string instead. That is how a
    live proxy login and password reached a public CI log.

    Anything it cannot take apart is redacted whole rather than echoed.

    IT TAKES A BARE URL, NOT A SENTENCE. Given "a http://u:p@h:8080 b" it
    returns "?://?" — the password is gone, which is the property that
    matters, but so is the host and port the log was written to show. Every
    caller in this repo therefore passes the URL as its own `%s` argument
    and never interpolates it into a message first. For arbitrary text that
    may contain a credential anywhere, each engine has
    `_mask_credentials()`, which is a global regex and keeps the rest of the
    string intact. `smoke_test` pins both behaviours so a future edit that
    swaps them shows up as a failing check rather than as an unreadable log.
