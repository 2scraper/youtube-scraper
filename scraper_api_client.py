youtube-scraper — 2captcha Scraper API edition (fourth engine)

Fetches one page through the 2captcha Scraper API, which renders it on
2captcha's infrastructure and returns the HTML over plain HTTPS.

What this path can and cannot do HERE, measured
-----------------------------------------------
This is the one engine in this repo that cannot read comments, and the
reason is a property of the SITE rather than of the service — so it is
stated with the measurement rather than as an opinion (CLAUDE.md §19).

YouTube puts no comments in its HTML. The document ships a placeholder and
the browser then asks for them over a POST to `/youtubei/v1/next`. A
service that fetches a URL and returns the rendered document therefore
returns a page whose comment section is still empty. Measured 2026-09-21
against `/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`:

    no waitFor                      HTTP 200,  1,354,420 bytes,  0 comments
    waitFor {"state":"networkidle"} HTTP 200,  1,386,808 bytes,  0 comments
    waitFor {"element":"ytd-comment-thread-renderer","checkVisible":true}
                                    HTTP 408 timeout — it never appears
    waitFor {"text":"Top comments"} HTTP 408 timeout

Control, per CLAUDE.md §20: a deliberately wrong key answered HTTP 401 in
0.1 s where the real one answered 200 in 6.7 s, so the endpoint is
evaluating credentials and the 200s above are real work.

So `--mode video` is what this client does, and it does it well: the watch
document carries the video's whole metadata inline, which is exactly the
shape a rendered-HTML service is good for. For comments, use one of the
three browser engines — or nothing at all, because the endpoint they call
is ungated and free.

And the honest sentence about when to pay for this at all: on this site,
not for access. Measured the same day from a bare Finnish datacentre
address with no key and no proxy, 60 consecutive InnerTube pages returned
1,200 comments with no refusal of any kind. What this client buys is
somebody else's browser infrastructure and a specific exit country.
