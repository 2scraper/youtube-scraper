"""
CI checks that are too long to live inside the workflow YAML.

They started out as heredocs in `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and moved here
for one practical reason: a Python block nested inside YAML inside a shell
`run:` needs three levels of quoting to stay intact, and shell-quoted regexes
like '(ws|wss)://[^ "'"'"']+' do not survive being copied through a browser.
A separate .py file is copy-paste safe, runs locally, and can be read on its
own.

Run any of these from the repo root:

    python .github/ci_checks.py --help-check
    python .github/ci_checks.py --sample-check
    python .github/ci_checks.py --secret-check
    python .github/ci_checks.py --all

Each prints what it looked at and exits non-zero on failure.
