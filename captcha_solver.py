captcha_solver.py
------------------
Shared helper used by all three scrapers (Playwright / Selenium / Puppeteer).

Detection runs after EVERY page navigation in the main loop of all three
scrapers, regardless of what URL was requested — this is deliberate, not
scoped to any one page, because which challenge a visitor meets depends on
the exit and on what the address has been doing.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR ON YOUTUBE
----------------------------------
**Nothing, as measured — and the honest version of that sentence is
narrow.**

On 2026-09-21, from a bare datacentre address in Finland with no key, no
proxy and no cookies, YouTube served everything this scraper reads: the
watch page at 1.36 MB, and 60 consecutive InnerTube pages returning 1,200
comments with no refusal of any kind. No challenge has ever been rendered
to this scraper.

But "no challenge rendered" is NOT "no captcha configured" (CLAUDE.md
§18), so the served watch page was grepped for the site's own captcha
configuration the way that section says to. The answer is unusual enough
to be worth the paragraph, because two of the three obvious greps LIE:

    recaptcha              1 hit — and it is a CSS rule,
                           `.grecaptcha-badge{visibility:hidden}`, in a
                           stylesheet. No widget, no loader, no sitekey.
    botguard              13 hits — and every one is a configuration flag
                           such as `botguard_async_snapshot_timeout_ms`.
                           Not a challenge; a timeout for one.
    data-sitekey           0        <captcha-*>   0
    /recaptcha/api.js      0        turnstile     0
    hcaptcha               0        SITE_KEY      0

So a reader working from `--dump-html` and grepping for "recaptcha" would
report that this site runs reCAPTCHA. It does not. What it actually runs
is **its own attestation** — `bgChallenge` with an `interpreterUrl`,
Google's BotGuard — which is not a third-party widget, has no sitekey, and
is not the kind of thing any solver takes a task for. There is nothing
here for this module to buy.

What YouTube is DOCUMENTED to render when it does refuse is a sign-in
interstitial ("Sign in to confirm you're not a bot"). That wording is
carried in `product_parser.BOT_CHALLENGE_MARKERS` and is marked there as
documented-but-unverified, because this scraper has never seen it. An
interstitial that demands an ACCOUNT is not a captcha either, and no
solver clears it.

So this module is insurance on YouTube rather than a route in use. The
machinery below — the `turnstile.render` interception, the enterprise task
types, the variant heuristic — is here so that a site which starts
rendering a solvable challenge is met with tools that already work, and
every one of its figures comes from a sibling repo rather than from here.

What is NOT true, and must never be written, is that a captcha here
"cannot be solved". 2captcha solves Cloudflare Turnstile
(`TurnstileTaskProxyless`), enterprise reCAPTCHA
(`RecaptchaV2EnterpriseTaskProxyless`) and ordinary v2/v3, and this module
builds all of them. The only sentence this repo is entitled to is which
task types it implements and what it has actually met (CLAUDE.md §19).

PROVENANCE OF THE FIGURES BELOW
-------------------------------
This file is family core and carries measurements taken on SIBLING sites.
They are evidence about the SOLVER, not about YouTube, and are labelled as
such so nobody re-reads them as facts about this site — which matters more
here than usual, because this site has produced no such figures at all:

  * foodpanda-scraper, 2026-09-16: a Cloudflare Turnstile Challenge page
    solved via the `turnstile.render` interception — all four parameters
    captured, an 837-character token in 11 seconds, $0.00145, and the page
    came back as the real site.
  * foodpanda-scraper, 2026-09-16: `RecaptchaV2EnterpriseTaskProxyless` on a
    PerimeterX denial page, ~55 seconds, $0.00299. The control matters as
    much as the result — reloading that page in the same session WITHOUT
    solving cleared it 0 of 8 times, so the token is what got in.

Two things decide whether that money buys anything anywhere:

  * **the task type.** An enterprise widget solved as ordinary v2 returns a
    token the site rejects. `CaptchaChallenge.enterprise` carries the page's
    own answer — its loader, and `window.grecaptcha.enterprise` — into
    `_v2_task_for`.
  * **the variant.** A sibling's first live attempt read a bframe with no
    `size` as v3, bought a `RecaptchaV3TaskProxyless` and got
    ERROR_CAPTCHA_UNSOLVABLE after 87 seconds. v3 renders no challenge frame
    at all, so a frame present settles it as a v2 checkbox.

Detection therefore stays BROAD while spending stays NARROW:
`--solve-captcha when-blocked` is the default and counts job links before
paying, `page_flow.SOLVES_PER_PAGE` caps a page at one purchase, and
`page_flow.STATE_POLICY` — not this file — decides which state is worth
money at all.

There is deliberately no DataDome path here. See "No DataDome solver" below.

Flow:
  1. Both detectors run and are reconciled (see reconcile_detections) to
     decide the variant: v3, v2-invisible or v2-checkbox. The parameters
     differ per variant and are not interchangeable — v3 params sent for a
     v2-invisible widget buy a token the site rejects.
  2. The challenge goes to 2captcha's API (v2 by default, legacy v1 as a
     one-shot fallback) with the parameters for that variant.
  3. The token is injected — into `g-recaptcha-response` for reCAPTCHA, or
     into `cf-turnstile-response` plus the page's own callback for Turnstile.

Often none of this is needed. Over the Scraping Browser API,
`Captcha.setAutoSolve` can clear the challenge inside the browser before this
code gets a turn — treat `Captcha.solveFinished` as the success signal and
keep this path as the fallback. This module is the path for a browser you
launched yourself.

No other captcha vendor is integrated (per spec: no competitors).

#   <captcha-widget data-version="v3" data-sitekey="6Leif..." ...>
# with the whole config in HTML attributes. Verified live on 2026-08-24, that
# element is GONE. The modal now loads
#   https://recaptcha.net/recaptcha/api.js?render=explicit
# and configures the widget entirely in JavaScript, into a
#   <div id="register-captcha" class="g-recaptcha">
# container. There is no `data-sitekey`, no inline `grecaptcha.execute(...)`,
# and no `grecaptcha.render` anywhere in the served HTML — all four things
# detect_recaptcha_v3() keys off are absent. It returns None on this page
# even though a real reCAPTCHA is present and active.
#
# The sitekey is still recoverable, but only at runtime, from two places
# that exist in the live page and not in its HTML:
#   1. window.___grecaptcha_cfg.clients — the reCAPTCHA API's own client
#      registry. Property names inside it are minified and change between
#      releases, so this walks the object looking for a value shaped like a
#      sitekey (^6L[\w-]{30,}$) rather than trusting any key name.
#   2. the reCAPTCHA iframe's `k=` query parameter — a stable, documented
#      part of the widget's URL, used as a cross-check and fallback.
#
# The same client config also carries `size`, which is what tells v3 apart
# from v2-invisible. That distinction is not cosmetic: 2captcha needs
# `version=v3` + `action` + `min_score` for one and `invisible=1` for the
# other, and sending the wrong one burns balance for a token that won't
# validate.

    `evaluate` is a callable that runs RECAPTCHA_DISCOVERY_JS in the page and
    returns the resulting dict — i.e. `page.evaluate` under Playwright,
    `driver.execute_script` under Selenium (wrap it so the arrow function is
    invoked), or an awaited `page.evaluate` under pyppeteer.

    Version inference, and why it is deliberately conservative:
      * `size == "invisible"` PLUS an interactive bframe iframe present is
        the signature of **v2-invisible**, not v3 — v3 never renders a
        challenge frame. This is what that site looked like as of
        2026-08-24, on the same sitekey that its old markup explicitly
        labelled `data-version="v3"`.
      * `size == "invisible"` with no challenge frame is treated as v3,
        which is v3's normal appearance (badge only).
      * an interactive bframe present with NO size and NO render parameter is
        a **v2 checkbox**. v3 never renders a challenge frame, so the frame
        alone rules it out. foodpanda's PerimeterX denial page is exactly
        this shape, and before this rung existed it was classified v3 and a
        solve was bought against the wrong task type.
      * a `normal`/`compact` size is a v2 checkbox.
    When the two signals disagree the ambiguity is recorded in the returned
    challenge's `kind` and in the log, rather than silently guessing — pick

      * `<captcha-widget data-version="v3" data-sitekey="6Leif..."

    Supporting detail: `data-action="null"` in that markup means there is no
    action string. v3 scores partly on the action; a real v3 integration
    passes one. An empty action fits a v2-invisible widget wearing a stale
    v3 label better than it fits working v3.

    the same day had NO `<captcha-widget>` element at all — just the

# What is deliberately NOT here
# ===========================================================================
# The sibling repo in this family carries a whole second solver for its
# site's OWN first-party image captcha ("Enter the characters you see below",
# a JPEG of distorted text and a GET form). Roughly 190 lines of it, and none
# of it is ported here, because this site has no such page.
#
# What this site does instead is refuse a HEADLESS browser. Measured
# 2026-09-10 from five different addresses, four of them residential: Akamai
# answers with HTTP 403 and a 394-byte "Access Denied" page carrying a
# reference id — no form, no image, no widget, nothing for a solver to
# answer. And the trigger is the CLIENT rather than the address: the very
# same addresses were served HTTP 200 and the full catalogue by a browser
# with a real window. So the response to a block here is `--headful` or
# `--cdp-endpoint`, not a solve and not a better proxy, and
# product_parser.detect_page_state reports it as "blocked" rather than
# "challenge" precisely so no solve is attempted and nothing is charged.
#
# The reCAPTCHA / hCaptcha / Turnstile machinery above IS kept, and that is a
# deliberate asymmetry rather than an inconsistency. Detection stays broad
# because which challenge a visitor meets depends on the exit country and on
# what the address has been doing — a narrow list is how a challenge gets
# reported as an empty page months later. A solver for a challenge this site
# has never been observed to serve is dead code; a DETECTOR for one is cheap
# insurance: a detection that fires on a page whose lots have
# already rendered guards nothing, which is why the default is
# `when-blocked` and why it counts lot links before it spends.
